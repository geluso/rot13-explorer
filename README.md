# ROT-13 Explorer
This program goes through a Scrabble dictionary and searches for
words that end up as other words after they've gone through ROT-13
encoding. 

The goal is to make ROT-13 ambigious phrases that have meaning
no matter which side of ROT-13 they're on. The best phrase I've
came up with is:

```
fur or pyrex?
she be clerk?
```

Not the most interetsing results. But now we know!

The entire program will produce all word pairs, but here's a curated
sample list:

```
ab,no
abba,noon
ant,nag
bar,one
barf,ones
be,or
clerk,pyrex
cub,pho
envy,rail
flap,sync
frag,sent
fur,she
gel,try
gnat,tang
green,terra
grr,tee
mmm,zzz
```
